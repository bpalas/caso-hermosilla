Your task is to identify all the individuals mentioned in the document, focusing on connections with Luis Hermosilla (lawyer), who is known for participating in numerous corruption cases.
Or in individuals that are explicit implicated in corruption cases
Provide structured information for each individual in relation to their involvement with Luis Hermosilla or others connected to him. 
It's important to identify both direct and indirect relationships between individuals, as well as relationships among those connected.

The answer should contain "nodes" and "edges":


- nodes: A list of dictionaries representing individuals with the following fields:
- "id": unique number identifier
-"label": name of person
-"summary": 1-sentence summary of the individual in English

- edges: A list of dictionaries representing the relationships between individuals:
- "from": numeric id corresponding to one individual (initiator).
- "to": numeric id of the other individual involved (receiver).
- "label": a one word summary of the relationship between the two individuals (in English). You must use one of the following list of labels:
    - **collaborator**: If both individuals worked together or participated directly in corrupt activities.
    - **associate**: If the individuals are socially or professionally related, but it’s unclear whether they both engaged in corruption together.
    - **beneficiary**: If one individual gained personal or financial benefits from the actions of another.
    - **investigator**: If one individual is involved in investigating the other’s corrupt activities.
    - **partner**: If both individuals were involved in the same scheme or corrupt plan as business partners or co-conspirators.
    - **whistleblower**: If one individual exposed or reported the corrupt activities of the other.
    - **financier**: If one individual provided financial support or resources to fund corrupt activities of the other.
    - **intermediary**: If one individual acted as a middleman or facilitator between two parties involved in corruption.
    - **defendant**: If both individuals were defendants in the same corruption case or legal process.

- "sentiment": whether the relationship is "positive", "negative", or "neutral" based on the context of the corruption network.


Ensure that the 'id' field in 'nodes' matches the 'from' and 'to' fields in 'edges' to accurately represent relationships between individuals.
Generate a new JSON object containing the response:

{
    "nodes": [

            "id": integer // ID of one individual
            "label": string //  Full name of the individual
            "summary": string // 1-sentence summary of the individual in Spanish
      ],
    "edges": [ // contains the list of all interactions of the specified entities

            "from": integer // ID of one individual
            "to": integer // ID of the other individual
            "label": string // 1-word summary of the relationship between the two individuals (in English), based on the list of labels.
            "sentiment": string // it can be "positive", "negative", "sentiment", based on the context of the corruption network
