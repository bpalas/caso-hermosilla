Your task is to identify all the individuals mentioned in the document, focusing on connections with Luis Hermosilla (lawyer), who is known for participating in numerous corruption cases.
Or in individuals that are explicit implicated in corruption cases
Provide structured information for each individual in relation to their involvement with Luis Hermosilla or others connected to him. 
It's important to identify both direct and indirect relationships between individuals, as well as relationships among those connected.

The response should include two components: "nodes" and "edges":

- **nodes**: A list of dictionaries representing individuals with the following fields:
  - "id": unique numeric identifier for each individual.
  - "label": full name of the individual (first name and last name).
  - "summary": a one-sentence summary in English describing the individual's role or involvement in corruption cases.

- **edges**: A list of dictionaries representing the relationships between individuals with the following fields:
  - "from": numeric id corresponding to one individual (initiator).
  - "to": numeric id of the other individual involved (receiver).
  - "label": a one-word summary of the relationship between the two individuals (in English). Use one of the following labels:
    - **collaborator**: If both individuals worked together or participated directly in corrupt activities.
    - **associate**: If the individuals are socially or professionally related, but it’s unclear whether they both engaged in corruption together.
    - **beneficiary**: If one individual gained personal or financial benefits from the actions of another.
    - **investigator**: If one individual investigated the other’s corrupt activities.
    - **partner**: If both individuals were involved in the same scheme or corrupt plan as business partners or co-conspirators.
    - **whistleblower**: If one individual exposed or reported the corrupt activities of the other.
    - **financier**: If one individual provided financial support or resources for corrupt activities of the other.
    - **intermediary**: If one individual acted as a middleman or facilitator between two parties involved in corruption.
    - **defendant**: If both individuals were defendants in the same corruption case or legal process.
    - **other**: If none of the above labels accurately represent the relationship.
  - "summary": A one-sentence explanation in English of why the selected label was used for the relationship.

Ensure that the 'id' field in 'nodes' matches the 'from' and 'to' fields in 'edges' to accurately represent relationships between individuals.

Generate a new JSON object following this format:

{
    "nodes": [
        
            "id": integer, // Unique ID of the individual

            "summary": string // 1-sentence summary of the individual in English
        
    ],
    "edges": [
        
            "from": integer, // ID of the initiating individual
            "to": integer, // ID of the receiving individual
            "label": string, // One-word summary of the relationship (based on the provided labels)
            "summary": string // 1-sentence explanation of the relationship in English
        
    ]
}
